# Vaultify

#### Set up the node modules

After downloading the repo, you will need to install the packages. There are two places to do this.

First, in the project root, run `npm install`. 

Second, in the client/ folder, run `npm install` again.


#### Run the development server

You will need two terminal sessions active. 

1. From the project root, run `node bin/www` to start the backend (available at `localhost:3001`).

2. From `client/`, run `npm run start` to start the development server. Any changes you make within the `client/src` directory will be compiled automatically and served to `localhost:3000`.
